          <h2>Cyber Hacking Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Engage in a cyber hacking challenge by executing penetration
            testing and vulnerability scanning on the designated system with
            the following aims:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Discover and document at least two exploits providing remote
              command-line access for each target system. Out of these two
              exploits for each target system, at least one method, either
              directly or through privilege escalation, must allow you to gain
              full control over the machine, equivalent to the root,
              Administrator, or SYSTEM user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Discover at least two existing user accounts (usernames and
              passwords) that provide remote command-line access for each target
              system. The existing passwords must be provided in plain text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Document your methods and the results, and include an executive
              summary that outlines the next steps to be taken.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hint: Use VirtualBox and Kali Linux to find vulnerabilities if you
              want to try this challenge.
            </li>
          </ol>
